## Repositories

⚠️ **The project spans two repositories.** Identify with `git remote -v` and `git fetch`
before searching for a file. Assuming a single repo has previously produced false
"file not found" reports.

| Repo | Local path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `akio-ai/theseus-phase0` | `~/Theseus_Phase0` | Governance docs, migration/canonical pipeline, **Research Layer** |
| `akio-ai/theseus-project` | `~/Theseus_Project` | The application. `main` auto-deploys to production |

### `theseus-phase0` — verified refs (2026-08-05)

| Ref | SHA | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `origin/main` | `30d90d1` | Baseline |
| `origin/docs/ai-autonomous-execution-policy` | `625f8ea` | **PR #4 open** → `main` |
| `research/producer-layer-batch1-3` | `6b4cc30` → | **PR #5 open** → `main`. Research Layer + `docs/state/`. Batch 4 commits sit on the same branch |

Untracked and deliberately **not** committed: `migration/` (canonical DB — gitignored on the
research branch), `intake/`, `research/producers/_sources/` (source cache — gitignored).

### `theseus-project` — verified refs (2026-08-05)

| Ref | SHA | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `origin/main` | `c9f3897` | **Unchanged.** Production auto-deploy target. ARIADNE not yet shipped here |
| `origin/integration/ariadne-current-main` | `c4ddde1` | Phase 3B U1+U2+U3 + specification system |
| `origin/feature/ariadne-hybrid-ui` | **`601a2ba`** | **PR #10 open**, base = `integration/...`, not draft |
| `origin/feature/phase3b-u3` | `450f44a` | Merged via PR #9 |

🔴 **PR #10's head is `601a2ba`.** Earlier notes recorded `8d42c47`; that is out of date.

Local worktrees exist under session scratchpad directories; three are marked **prunable**
(`ariadne-integration` @ `58f2bd9`, `u3-impl` @ `450f44a`, `ariadne-audit` @ `2ab6841`).
The working checkout `~/Theseus_Project` sits on `feature/theseus-logo-mark` @ `cd03b3f`
with modified icon assets in the working tree.

## Active workstream — Producer Research Layer

**Status: Batch 6 complete. Batch 7 in progress (Akio approved Batches 5–7 on 2026-08-05).**

| | |
|---|---|
| Dossiers | **38** — `research/producers/*.md` |
| OBP coverage | **325 / 704 bottles (46.2%)** — Batch 5 **+44**, Batch 6 **+36** |
| Remaining | **144 producers / 379 bottles** |
| Conflicts register | `research/canonical_conflicts/REGISTER.md` — 20 true conflicts, 54 false positives separated. **Batches 5 and 6 added no new entries** (they added evidence to C-4, C-5, S-2, P-1, P-7 and V-3) |
| Canonical writes | **Zero.** Read-only throughout |

⚠️ **Coverage figure corrected.** The pre-Batch-5 number was recorded as **256 / 704 (36.4%)**.
Recomputing it from `obp_intake_normalized_20260804.json` with an explicit, hand-verified
dossier→producer map gives **245 / 704 (34.8%)** for the same 26 dossiers. The 11-bottle gap could
not be reproduced from the intake file; the counting script is now kept at
`research/producers/coverage.py` so the figure is reproducible. **All numbers in this
document use the recomputed basis.**

| Batch | Producers |
|---|---|
| Pre-batch (2) | Domaine Leflaive, Louis Latour |
| Batch 1 (5) | DRC, Faiveley, Simon Bize et Fils, Château Lafite-Rothschild, Jean-Louis Chave |
| Batch 2 (7) | Doyard, Dunoyer de Segonzac, Larmandier-Bernier, Les Monts Fournois, Michel Gonet, Pascal Agrapart, Pierre Péters |
| Batch 3 (6) | Egly-Ouriet, Drappier, Pierre Gimonnet & Fils, Laherte Frères, Jérôme Prévost, Frédéric Savart |
| Batch 4 (6) | Pride Mountain Vineyards, Grgich Hills Estate, Domaine Dujac, Jacques-Frédéric Mugnier, Domaine Denis Mortet, Domaine de Montille |
| Batch 5 (6) | Domaine Armand Rousseau, Ganevat, Domaine Billaud-Simon, Joseph Drouhin, Olivier Bernstein, Pol Roger |
| **Batch 6 (6)** | **Domaine Bruno Clair, Domaine d'Eugénie, Domaine des Comtes Lafon, Jean-Claude Ramonet, Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey, Caroline Morey** |

**Batch 4 notes.** Two producers (Pride Mountain, Grgich Hills) had **no canonical producer record at
all** — 18 OBP bottles were `producer_state = unresolved` purely for that reason. Both US dossiers
reached **High** confidence because both wineries publish per-vintage technical data. Two structural
findings are recorded in the dossiers and **not acted on**: Pride Mountain's appellation string
changes per vintage (`64% Napa / 36% Sonoma` / `Napa County` / `Napa Valley`), which the current
one-subregion-per-cuvée model cannot express; and de Montille's four Corton rows stall at
`candidate` on a single character (`Clos de Roi` vs `Clos du Roi`).

**Batch 5 notes.**
- **Joseph Drouhin covers 10 bottles, not 7** — the same dossier resolves `Joseph Drouhin` (7),
  `Drouhin-Vaudon` (2) and `Drouhin` = Domaine Drouhin Oregon (1), which are three separate
  canonical producers. Drouhin publishes a per-wine **`Supply:`** field stating whether each wine is
  estate fruit, estate + purchased, or **purchased only** — two OBP bottles are purchased-only.
- 🔴 **Ganevat is the first dossier deliberately left below the bar: `reached_70: NO (~55%)`.**
  Its official site (`ganevat.fr`) returns a maintenance page with no content, so there is no
  producer-authored source at all. The dossier is built entirely from **Agence Bio** (French public
  register), **Ecocert** and **Demeter France** (certifiers) and the **INAO cahier des charges**.
  History, winemaking and style are recorded as unavailable rather than inferred. Treat as
  **`awaiting material from the team`**.
- **Billaud-Simon's legal notice names `Mrs Eve Faiveley` as Publication Director** — a direct link
  to the existing `domaine-faiveley.md` dossier. The site says nothing about ownership, so the
  dossier states only what the legal notice states.
- **Two OBP rows printed `Joseph Drouhin | Côte de Beaune | 2023 | $240` are not a duplicate** —
  one is in the WHITE section and one in RED, and Drouhin makes both.
- **A systematic canonical defect surfaced across three Batch-5 producers**: cuvée names stored with
  literal double quotes (`"Clos Saint-Jacques"`, `"Les Preuses"`, `"Mont de Milieu"`,
  `"Marquis de Laguiche"`). Recorded under **S-2**, not as new entries.

**Batch 6 notes.**
- 🔴🔴 **Three of the six had no usable producer source, and the failure mode was a trap, not an
  absence.** `comtes-lafon.com` presents as the official site — first person, `/history`,
  `/philosophy`, `/vineyards` — but its bundle carries the line *"This account is an independent fan
  page … not affiliated with or endorsed by the official company."* `ramonet.fr` is a Dovendi
  domain-for-sale page. `caroline-morey.com` is a Newport Beach wedding photographer. **None of
  their content was used.**
  → **New standing check before any site is treated as official: legal notice, disclaimer text,
  reciprocal link from the owner/appellation body, or address matching a public register.**
  In Batch 6 only `brunoclair.com` (legal notice + contact) and `domaine-eugenie.com` (reciprocal
  link from Artémis Domaines) passed.
- **Four dossiers are deliberately below the bar** — Comtes Lafon (~45%), Ramonet (~35%),
  Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey (~30%), Caroline Morey (~30%). All are built from INAO cahiers des charges
  and the Agence Bio register only, and all are marked **`awaiting material from the team`**.
- **Bruno Clair states in writing why it is *not* certified organic** — to keep synthetic mildew
  treatments available in years like 2016 — while using none in years like 2019–2020. It also
  publishes a per-wine, per-vintage *drink now / lay down* table: **5 of the 6 OBP bottles are
  `lay down` by the producer's own judgement.**
- 🔴 **Domaine d'Eugénie's official wine list is 11 wines, all Pinot Noir — the three OBP whites
  (Chassagne `Les Perclos`, Meursault 1er `Porusots`, Montrachet GC) are not on it**, although the
  estate page does claim holdings in Chassagne-Montrachet and Meursault. **Their attribution is
  unresolved and the dossier refuses to assert it.**
- **Ramonet located the cause of two `candidate` stalls**: canonical `Le Montrachet Grand Cru` vs
  menu `Montrachet Grand Cru` (leading article), and canonical `Chassagne-Montrachet Blanc` vs menu
  `Chassagne-Montrachet` (colour word in the name). The first is the same article-normalisation
  issue already recorded from Batch 4's de Montille; the second is solvable from the OBP section.

Governing workflow: fixed template, **70% completeness bar**, four evidence layers never mixed
(verified fact / source-derived / Akio's insight / unresolved), `## Akio's Insight` is
**Akio-only and never written or rewritten by anyone else**, official sources only
(Wikipedia prohibited), canonical duplicates are **escalated, never resolved**.

## Paused workstream — ARIADNE Phase 3B

- Phase 3B **U3 complete**, merged via PR #9. **U4 not started.**
- **PR #10 (Hybrid UI) is open and unmerged.**
- The aroma-selection redesign (Fruit Basket Explore/List) is **prototype only** — neither PR #10
  nor the DB was touched by it.
- **U4's decisive branch point is the Application Cutover Gate (AQ-3)** — irreversible after the
  first real observation is written.

## Blockers

Everything below is **waiting on Akio**, not on execution capacity. See
[`NEXT_ACTIONS.md`](NEXT_ACTIONS.md).

1. Batch 5 approval (producer research)
2. Review / merge of PR #5
3. Hero artwork confirmation (ARIADNE)
4. Schema-change permission (aroma intensity / complexity / 11-family taxonomy — all need migrations)
5. Fruit Basket: ship or not
6. `Les Hautes Mottes 2018` — physical bottle or importer sheet needed

## Operating constraints in force

- **No push without CEO approval.** Commit freely; do not push.
- **Never `--amend` on a shared repo.** Verify HEAD is your own commit first.
- `git add -A`, `git clean -fdx`, `rebase`, force-push are **prohibited**. Explicit paths only.
- PRs reference `Tracks #N`; **`Closes` is prohibited**.
- **Done** = merged **and** validated **and** documentation updated **and** acceptance criteria met.
- Project field writes are not granted; report required transitions instead.
- **This machine has no `node`.** Run JS/tests with `jsc`.
- `gh` can silently switch active account → `gh auth status` → `gh auth switch --user akio-ai`
  → `gh auth setup-git`.
- `docs/specifications/` TEMPLATE / style-guide / README are **frozen**; changes require an ADR.
